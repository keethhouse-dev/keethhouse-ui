      "At Keeth House, we are a small team comprised of our friends and families from local villages near Auroville. While we may not operate like a traditional hotel with 24/7 reception and services, we strive to offer a tranquil and delightful experience. Our availability is from 8 am to 10 pm daily, and our security guard is also present throughout the night for added peace of mind.",
      "If you desire daily cleaning, kindly inform us upon check-in or in the morning. Your privacy is paramount to us; we respect your space but remain eager to assist whenever needed.",

    title: "Your First Keeth House Experience",
    paragraphs: [
      "Step into Keeth House, nestled within the embrace of local nature. While our commitment to cleanliness is unwavering, our rustic setting invites occasional guests like insects, furry caterpillars (best admired from a distance), frogs, snakes, and mice. Kindly bear this in mind before booking, as we coexist harmoniously with these creatures.",
      "There are venomous snakes in this region, thus we urge you to turn on your lights when moving around in the night. Snakes would never attack you — you just need to make sure not to step on them. Please, don't touch furry caterpillars; they can bruise your skin and bring a rash. Despite our diligent efforts, encounters with spiders, bugs, and mosquitoes are part of our natural surroundings.",
      "If these encounters make you uncomfortable, perhaps an alternative accommodation might better suit your preferences. Embrace the off-the-grid experience with us at Keeth House.",

    title: "In-House Kitchen",
    paragraphs: [
      "We're delighted to offer South Indian Breakfast which is included, and the Lunch charges are 700 INR for a couple. Kindly inform us in advance. We have the Tree Top Kafe in Phase III — an exclusive café set atop a tree, offering a truly unique experience. Do take some time to visit and unwind with the views, sounds, and stillness around you. We provide RO water and kindly request our guests to refill their bottles at the designated refill station.",
      "Additionally, we'd be glad to suggest some cafés in Auroville and Pondicherry for you to explore during your stay at Keeth House. Swiggy and Zomato deliveries are not permitted, to help us reduce plastic containers and packaging entering the premises.",
      "Moreover, you have the option to use our self-help kitchenette in all the houses except The Khaya Nest. We look forward to enhancing your experience at Keeth House.",

    title: "Transportation and Arrival / Departure Support",
    paragraphs: [
      "We kindly ask guests to check in between 12 pm and 7 pm to avoid any inconvenience. Kindly aim to avoid arriving later than 8 pm, as it can pose challenges and may not be feasible in some cases. Check-out time is by 10 am.",
      "For those interested in transportation assistance, we can provide contacts for our trusted drivers once your reservation is confirmed. Our recommended drivers offer pickup services from various city locations. For late-night arrivals due to flights, we recommend our verified drivers for a safe and fair-priced journey to Keeth House.",
      "You could also rent a scooter from us at the property for your commute to cafes and beaches. Please check with the property manager for the rental charges.",
      "Your early check-in request is important to us, and we would love to accommodate it based on the availability. However, note that if we have a booking scheduled prior to your arrival, we can only provide you with access to the house by 12 pm. We kindly request your understanding and cooperation in planning your arrival accordingly.",

Pondicherry Airport is a convenient 25-minute drive, and Chennai International Airport is around 3 hours away. For getting around comfortably, we recommend renting a scooter.",
