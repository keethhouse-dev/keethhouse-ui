              The leaves carry the memory of the soil—the warmth of the earth
              they once sprouted from, the water that coursed through their
              veins, the air that whispered along their edges. The reeds
              remember how the river flowed around them, bending and swaying,
              yet never breaking. And the houses—woven from these very leaves
              and reeds—carry the imprints of the people who shaped them: the
              hands that wove them together, turning what once belonged to the
              wilderness into a home.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keeth House is more than a shelter; it is a memory of the land
              and its people. A house that breathes, sways with the wind,
              absorbs the rains, and dries under the sun. A house that ages,
              just as we do.

              Life in a Keeth House is not separate from nature—it is
              intertwined with it. Just as we call it home, other creatures
              find comfort here too. Squirrels scurry across the roof, while
              frogs, foxes, snakes, and even peacocks pass by, reminding you
              that the water channel is near and the land is still wild and
              undisturbed enough for them to belong.
            </p>
            <p>
              They are not intruders; they are neighbours—living proof of a
              world where the boundaries between humans and nature blur.

              Keeth is a symbol of climate adaptability—a craft honed over
              generations, yet slowly disappearing. India's traditional
              architecture is known for structures that have endured time and
              nature. Some stand strong in durability, while others, like
              Keeth Houses, thrive in adaptability. Woven from coconut or palm
              leaves, these homes remain naturally cool, their elevated roofs
              allowing hot air to escape. One can find them across South
              India, where the summers are intense. When layered with{" "}
              <em>Vezhal</em> (reed), it further strengthens the structure,
              shielding from the monsoons and the winters.
            </p>
            <p>
              These homes do not resist nature—they move with it, breathe with
              it, and adapt to it. With each Keeth House we build, we also
              ensure that this craft stays alive.

              A Keeth House is not a place you simply live in—it is a home
              that asks for your care. Unlike a concrete structure, it does
              not stand apart from you, demanding nothing in return. Instead,
              it invites you into a relationship. It asks you to watch over
              it, to tend to it, to ensure the ants do not feed on its fibers,
              to check if its structure remains intact. It asks you to build
              a community, one where people come together when the rain
              falls, repairing and restoring what the seasons take away.
            </p>
            <p>
              To live in a Keeth House is to understand the rhythm of nature.
              It is to embrace the cycle of building, tending, and renewing.
              It is to cherish what is closest to us—both the Earth and the
              people who share it with us.

              With every Keeth House that is built, a piece of land is spared
              from the weight of concrete. With every home woven from leaves
              and reeds, a craft is kept alive. Livelihoods are created for
              artisans who still remember the old ways, and through them,
              more people find their way back to the wisdom of using natural
              materials. We hope to create a space that gives back more than
              it takes—a space where the land is honoured, the craft is
              protected, and life coexists in harmony with nature.
            </p>
            <p>
              A Keeth House is more than a home. It is a story of the land. A
              story of the people. A story that continues, as long as we
              choose to remember.
